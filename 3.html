    <ol><h1>Factors Effecting Biodiversity</h1>
        <img src="Images/habitatlossfragmentation.jpg"><li><h3>Habitat loss and fragmentation:</h3>This is considered the single biggest culprit in biodiversity decline. It occurs when natural habitats, like forests, wetlands, and grasslands, are destroyed or broken up into smaller, isolated patches. This can happen due to several reasons:</li>
        <ul>
            <br><img src="Images/Deforestation.jpg"><li><b>Deforestation:</b>Clearing land for agriculture, logging, and development destroys vast areas of habitat, leaving many species homeless and unable to find food or mates.</li>
        <li><b>Urbanization:</b>As cities sprawl, they encroach on natural areas, fragmenting remaining habitats and creating "islands" of wildlife surrounded by concrete.</li>
        <li><b>Roads and Infrastructure:</b>Building roads, railways, and other infrastructure can physically divide habitats, making it difficult for animals to move freely and find resources.</li>
        <li><b>Fragmentation itself:</b>Even if some natural habitat remains, breaking it up into smaller pieces can be detrimental. Smaller areas often can't support as many species, and edge effects become more pronounced. Edge effects are the changes in environmental conditions along the borders of habitats, which can be harsher for some species.</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <img src="Images/climatechange.jpg"><li><h3>Climate Change:</h3>Our planet's climate is rapidly changing due to human activities, causing rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more extreme weather events. These changes disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems, making it difficult for species that have adapted to specific conditions to survive.</li>
    <ul><li><b>Rising temperatures:</b> Many species are adapted to specific temperature ranges. As temperatures rise, they may struggle to find suitable habitats or experience physiological stress.</li>
    <li><b>Changes in precipitation:</b> Droughts and floods caused by altered precipitation patterns can devastate ecosystems. For example, droughts can lead to water scarcity and habitat loss, while floods can displace species and disrupt food webs.</li>
    <li><b>Ocean acidification:</b> Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere are causing the oceans to become more acidic, which harms organisms that build shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, like corals and shellfish.</li>
    </ul><hr>
 <li><img src="Images/overexploration.jpg"><h3>Overexploitation:</h3>Humans are using natural resources at an unsustainable rate. This includes overfishing, overhunting, and logging. When these activities remove resources faster than they can be replenished, it can lead to population declines and even extinction of certain species.</li>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Overfishing:</b> Fishing practices that remove large numbers of fish from the ocean can disrupt food webs and deplete populations of commercially valuable species.</li>
        <li><b>Overhunting:</b> Excessive hunting can push prey species to the brink of extinction. This is particularly concerning for large predators, who play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems.</li>
        <li><b>Unsustainable logging:</b> Excessive removal of trees for timber and other uses can lead to deforestation and habitat loss. It can also disrupt the ecological processes of forests, such as water cycling and nutrient cycling.</li>
     </ul><hr>
<li><img src="Images/pollution.jpg"><h3>Pollution:</h3>Pollutants come from various sources, including industrial facilities, agricultural practices, and households. These pollutants can contaminate air, water, and soil, harming plants and animals in several ways.</li>
<ul>
    <li><b>Water Pollution:</b> Pollutants like industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff can contaminate waterways, making them toxic for aquatic life.</li>
    <li><b>Air Pollution:</b> Air pollution can harm respiratory systems of animals and reduce plant growth by limiting sunlight penetration.</li>
    <li><b>Soil Pollution:</b> Pollutants like pesticides and herbicides can kill beneficial soil organisms and disrupt nutrient cycling, making it difficult for plants to thrive.</li>
